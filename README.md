# Clean Edit for Joomla 4
A system plugin to make editing content in the front end of your Joomla 4 website distraction free.

![CLEAN (7)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1296369/205490612-45f38c4b-3527-4d9e-869f-54964cc28aa0.png)

## Why?
On a complex site or for example one with a large header graphic above the content it can be hard to see the content edit form. It may be below the fold or too narrow to make editing comfortable.

### Option 1 - Full Screen
Open the Edit Article page in full screen mode with just the form.

### Option 2 - Template
Use a specific template when editing content. This could for example be clean of all modules.
